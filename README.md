My name is Francesco Ciociola, I was born in 2001 and I am a great lover of IT and Technology in general. 👨‍💻

This passion of mine was born as a child 👦 but I started developing it at the "*ITE TONIOLO*" school 🏫 in **Manfredonia**. I currently study at the *University of Parma* in **Computer, Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering** (**Bachelor's Degree in Information Engineering**) 👨‍🎓. I have been attending **Scout** for *many years*, which has grown me a lot from the point of view of **responsibility** and **teamwork**.

My **favorite languages** are:
1. C++
2. Python
3. PHP
5. SQL
4. HTML5
5. C
6. CSS

But I am also *learning gradually*:
- C#
- JavaScript
- Bash
- Batch
- Matlab

Some projects I am proud of are:
- [Kekko01 AI 🤖](http://t.me/Kekko01_AIbot "Kekko01 AI")
- [My Moon Patrol 🚀](https://github.com/Kekko01/My-Moon-Patrol "My Moon Patrol")
- [Calcolo Prezzi 💸](https://github.com/Kekko01/Calcolo-Prezzi "Calcolo Prezzi")
- [Numeri Primi in TXT 🔢](https://github.com/Kekko01/Numeri-Primi-su-TXT "Numeri Primi in TXT")
- [My Hitori 🎲](https://github.com/Kekko01/My-Hitori "My Hitori")

As an OS I have dual boot with **Windows 10** and **Ubuntu**, but I am looking for other Linux OS. 

I also have **my blog**, which can be visited at the site: [https://kekko01.altervista.org/](https://kekko01.altervista.org/ "https://kekko01.altervista.org/")

I am a native speaker of **Italian**, but I also know **English (B1-B2)**
